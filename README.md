# Ebay-Kleinanzeigen-Used-Car-Listing-Price-Calculator
This project aims to provide Ebay-Kleinanzeigen users with a price recommendation for their used car listing given their used vehicle's characteristics. 
I visually demonstrate how and why the most important data cleaning decisions were made and then fit a basic XGBoost Regressor model on the clean data in order to make predictions. I confirm the model's effectiveness with K-Fold Cross Validation and then present a multi-level dropdown which can be interacted with in order to generate a price recommendation based on selected vehicle characteristics.
