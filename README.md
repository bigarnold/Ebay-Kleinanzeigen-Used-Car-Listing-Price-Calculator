# Ebay-Kleinanzeigen-Used-Car-Listing-Price-Calculator
This is a tangent notebook originating from a Dataquest portfolio project. It's aim is to provide users with a price recommendation for their Ebay-Kleinanzeigen used car listing given their used vehicle's characteristics. 
I aim to visually walk the viewer through how and why the most important data cleansing decisions were made and then apply a basic XGBoost Regressor model on the cleansed data in order to make predictions. I confirm the effectiveness of the model with K-Fold Cross Validation.
