# Ebay-Kleinanzeigen-Used-Car-Listing-Price-Calculator
This is a tangent notebook originating from a Dataquest portfolio project. Its aim is to provide users with a price recommendation for their Ebay-Kleinanzeigen used car listing given their used vehicle's characteristics. 
I aim to visually walk the viewer through how and why the most important data cleansing decisions were made and then fit a basic XGBoost Regressor model on the cleansed data in order to make predictions. I confirm the model's effectiveness with K-Fold Cross Validation and then present the viewer with a multi-level dropdown which can be interacted with in order to generate a price recommendation based on the selected characteristics.
